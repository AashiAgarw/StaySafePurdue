# StaySafePurdue



**Objectives**

 Our project interactively presents data from Purdue's Daily Crime Log in a Bubble Map using data scraping techniques and Google Maps API. 
 We hope that our user friendly visual of crime on campus empowers students to take control over their safety. 
 
 **Accomplishments**
 
 - Used a web scraping tool to efficiently add hundreds of purdue crime data points from purdue public records to a csv file. 
 - Used jupyter notebook to convert recorded building names into addresses, and then into coordinate points. Some issue were that the locations were entered manually, so spelling errors made it hard to automate this process. 
 - Adjusted the sizing and color opacity of the density points to make the data more readable. 

**Future Steps**

- Allow users to visualize different trends from the crime database. Specifically, we intend on implementing graphical analysis of the 
dates and timings of crimes, frequency of crimes of similar nature and severity, and the legal status of the crimes.
- Present our git-hub files on a more user-friendly website.
- Self update our code using new entries on the datatbase as well as user entries to our website.
- Allow users to self report crimes to more accurately show crimes that may not be considered "severe enough" to show up on police repports, but are still important enough to alert other purdue students about.
