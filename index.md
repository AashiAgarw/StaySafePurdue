# StaySafePurdue



**Objectives**

 Our project interactively presents data from Purdue's Daily Crime Log in a Bubble Map using data scraping techniques and Google Maps API. 
 We hope that our user friendly visual of crimes on campus empowers students to take control over their safety. 
 

**Future Steps**

- Allow users to visualize different trends from the crime database. Specifically, we intend on implementing graphical analysis of the 
dates and timings of crimes, frequency of crimes of similar nature and severity, and the legal status of the crimes.
- Present our git-hub files on a more user-friendly website.
- Self update our code using new entries on the datatbase as well as user entries to our website.


**Who are we**

StaySafePurdue is a freshman "Hello World" hackathon team. Contributers include Phoebe Abbruzzese, Aashi Agarwal, Tanay Gondil, and Daria Surmach.
Stay Safe Purdue!
